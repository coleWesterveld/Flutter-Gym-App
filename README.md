# firstapp

A new Flutter project.
I am trying to make an app I can use to track gym weights sets and notes, monitor progress, schedule workouts and create a workout program. 
I didnt like any of the apps online or I had to pay - I already know what I want, I just need to track. ion wanna pay for any fancy programs. 
Also I thought it would be cool to learn app development and I thought it would be cool if it was cross platofrm so I am l;earning Flutter through this project
So uhh dont expect much lol
