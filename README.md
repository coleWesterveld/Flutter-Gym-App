# Gym Progress Tracking App

A new Flutter project.
As of now, I track gym progress on a long note on my phone. I wanted to create an app to help me organize my tracking, and provide some extra features such as reminders as to what equipment I need to bring to the gym each day, timers for how long to rest, and more. Some apps already exist that do some of these things, however I felt that they were missing some features I would like or were expensive, had bloat/required internet that made the app harder to use for my simple purpose, or some combination of those. I was also looking for an excuse to get into app development, and wanted to create a free, open-source app for people to use. 

The plan is, when the app is ready, to put it on the app store and play store for free. 

Since this project is written in Dart with Flutter, with the one codebase it should be easy to upload to both, I have been able to emulate it on both Android and IOS. 

You can see the various screenshots of the apps development, and my progress in changing the UI and adding features to improve the app. the screenshots at the end with a higher ending number will be more recent, but I leave the old ones to show the progress throughout the project over time.
